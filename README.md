# CTFd random user picker

This is a quick and dirty python script that pciks random _non-podium_ (not top 3) participants and uses `randrange` 
to select a defined number of partipants to give prizes too

## WHY?
why not? - mainly because i thought it would be a transparent way to select winners

## Configuration
Configuration is done using the `config.py` (rename the `example.config.py` and add your own values)
